# A small test of "design mode" (give a Star when you come!)

<blockquote>
In order to better learn design patterns, and to urge myself to complete the study of design patterns, I will take notes as a note. Why, learn at least one design pattern every week! ! ! I urge everyone to supervise and educate us to learn and progress together! The content is mainly referenced from the two books "Zen of Design Patterns" and "Dahua Design Patterns", as well as related Internet blog posts!
